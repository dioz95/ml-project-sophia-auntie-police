# ml-project-sophia-auntie-police
This is a github repository for Machine Learning labs with Python project in Data Sciencetech Institute, Sophia batch A23

Git basic tutorial:
1. Make sure everything is work for you as described in clean it class.
2. Clone this repository in your local computer.
3. Open the project folder on the IDE
4. Don't forget to run `git pull` everytime you open the project to make sure it updated.

Collaborating with github:
1. Always make a new branch when you want to add/modify something `git branch [branch-name]` and `git checkout [branch-name]`
3. Add the file if you're sure it works by `git add [file-name]` for specific file or `git add .` for adding all file
4. Commit changes by `git commit -m [your-message]`
5. Push to main by `git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name]`
6. Create pull request in GitHub
7. Wait someone to approve your pull request, or you can skip if you're very sure of your work (not recommended).

**If anyone feels these procedure is too complicated, you can just drag and drop your work inside the notebook folder. I will manage the file organization at the end.**

# Update 24/11/2023
Since I realized that someone found difficulties in loading the data, I provide the data `books.csv` that the alignment has been corrected inside the dataset folder. Feel free to use it and I hope `pd.read_csv()` should work to it.
